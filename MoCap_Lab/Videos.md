## Required Introductory Videos

This section includes all of the videos that any user of the Vicon system should watch _before_ using the system in any way. These videos are essential and you will not be capable in any meaningful capacity without first watch them. It is recommended that you always calibrate the Vicon Motion Capture System before using it. Failure to do so may result in experiments failing unnecessarilly.
